## Key Mapper randomly stops

Key Mapper has been killed while it has been in the background. You must follow these steps so that the problem can be solved super quickly! If you go to the developer without reading this then they will show you this same text again so read it **now**! ðŸ™‚

Here is how to fix it:

1. Many phone manufacturers (especially Xiaomi and Huawei) love to kill apps when they are running in the background. ðŸ˜¡ This is **not** the developer's fault and there is nothing they can do to fix it so don't leave a bad review when this happens. **You** might be able to fix it by turning off these app killing "features". Follow the amazing online guide at [https://dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com) that shows you how to turn this all off.

2. Turn the accessibility service off and on again and try to use Key Mapper like normal.

    There is a shortcut to do this if you see the image below at the top of the Key Mapper home screen. Tap "Fix" and then "Restart" in the pop up. Otherwise, you will have you to go find the "Accessibility" settings in your device's settings yourself.

3. You must **not** do the rest of these steps if this is the first time that you have completed step 1 and 2.

4. In some **very rare** cases there is a bug in Key Mapper that causes it to crash while it is running in the background. You will need to send a bug report so that the developer can investigate the issue. Tap "Report bug" in Key Mapper's home screen menu.

## I can't unlock my phone because there is no keyboard!

You will need to reboot your device into "safe mode". The way to do this varies between devices so if these instructions don't work you will have to research how do to this for your device online.

For most devices you must...

1. Turn on your device.
2. Hold down on the power button until the on-screen power menu pops up.
3. Hold down on the "power off" (or sometimes "restart") button in the power menu.
4. A popup should say whether you want to boot into safe mode. Do this.
5. Unlock your device after it has rebooted into safe mode.
6. Reboot your device into normal mode by pressing power off or restart in the power menu. You do **not** need to hold down on the "power off"/"restart" button to boot into safe mode.

## External keyboard language is set to English US when using Key Mapper (Android 11 only)

This is a bug in Android 11 and should be fixed in Android 12. There is a setting in Key Mapper 2.3.0+ that helps you work around this issue. Read more [here](https://sds100.github.io/KeyMapper/redirects/android-11-device-id-bug-work-around).

## Key maps for an external device randomly stop working after a reboot
See issue [#783](https://github.com/sds100/KeyMapper/issues/783).

**Problem**: Key Mapper uses the device id (a.k.a descriptor) to ensure triggers from specific devices are only detected. The ids for some devices change after every reboot, which breaks this filtering. This is not supposed to happen but fortunately it only happens very rarely.
**Solution**: Set the device for the trigger to "any device" so Key Mapper accepts the trigger from any device.

## Volume increases to max/minimum when pressing power and the respective volume button when the device is off

This seems to be a bug with accessibility services on Android Pie+ on some devices. It also happens with the Macrodroid app when you only enable their accessibility service which filters key events. I tested Key Mapper with no code in the onKeyEvent function in the accessibility service and it still happens. These are the devices that I've tested.
